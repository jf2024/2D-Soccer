# 2D-Soccer
This is a game I created for my Senior Project, named 2-D Soccer. As the name suggests, it is presented in a 2D format, with the main goal being to score more goals than the opponent. Currently, my game features two distinct game modes: Single Player Mode, where the player faces an AI bot, and Two Player Mode, requiring two players to compete against each other instead of a bot. Throughout the gameplay, various power-ups (and power-downs) become available, capable of either aiding or hindering the players.

To delve deeper into my game's creation process, you can refer to the "Final Technical Document," which provides detailed insights into my thought process and the timeline for the game. This document also includes instructions for installing the game on your laptop, and I'll provide those installation steps here as well. 

**Note: The Game is currently intended for Windows/PC Users. If you have Mac or Linux, I'm sorry but it won't work for those operating systems**

### Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   Open the command prompt and run the following command to clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jf2024/2D-Soccer.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   Change your working directory to the project folder (wherever you cloned it):

   ```bash
   cd 2D-Soccer
   ```

3. **Go to where the executable file is located:**
   Once you are in the project folder, there should be a folder called 2D-Soccer that you will need to enter next. Sounds confusing since the project name is 2D-Soccer and inside of it there is another folder called 2D-Soccer but don't worry, that's how it's supposed to be, enter into that folder.

   ```bash
   cd 2D-Soccer
   ```

4. **Click on executable file:**
   Inside of the inner 2D-Soccer folder, there should be an exectuable file called "2D-Soccer" and the logo/icon should be that of a soccer ball. Double click it or however you prefer to open your files and the game should immediately start up. Enjoy!
